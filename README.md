# RobotAndBattery
### An implementation of the A Star search algorithm

By Running the FloorUI class you are able to design a maze by placing walls, then setting the robot's location using left click and the battery's location using right click.
After Setting the locations, by clicking the search button, the robot finds its path to the battery.
