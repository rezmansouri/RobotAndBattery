# RobotAndBattery
### An implementation of the A Star search algorithm

By Running the FloorUI class you are able to design a maze by placing walls, then setting the robot's location using left click and the battery's location using right click.
After Setting the locations, by clicking the search button, the robot finds its path to the battery.

The Maze input is given in a json format generated by the implemented UI.

The Start/Goal Tiles are also generated by the UI and given to the run() function in the Run class.

The format is as follows:

If one tile has two walls on its right and left and no wall on its top and bottom, "0101" is assigned to it. So we have a 2D array of strings.

According to this string, the Boolean values indicating whether there are walls around the tile or not are assigned values to.

According to those Boolean values, the successors are generated.


After initiating the floor containing the tiles, the robot starts to search using its own inner class called node which stores the tile associated with it, the path from start to the tile and the F cost.

Using 2 HashSets I implemented the fringe and the closed list.

Just like the classic A* algorithm, if the new node is already in fringe or closed, its cost is compared to the former node and if better, its replaced.

In the end an ArrayList containing the path tiles is generated by the robot and illustrated by UI.
